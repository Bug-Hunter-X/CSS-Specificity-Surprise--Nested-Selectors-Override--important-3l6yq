The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an unusual issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red !important;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

```

In this example, the `.child` class has an `!important` declaration, giving it the highest specificity.  However, the `parent .child` selector is even more specific, overriding the `!important` declaration. This can be unexpected behavior if developers assume that `!important` is always the highest priority.
